Examples of switch():

EXAMPLE 1 (simple version)
<?php
	$country = "France";
	
	switch ($country) {
		case "Canada":
			echo "Ottawa";
			break;
		case "USA":
			echo "Washington, DC";
			break;
		case "United Kingdon":
			echo "London";
			break;
		case "France":
			echo "Paris";
			break;
		default:
			//none of the 'cases' have been hit
			echo "not found";
			break;
	}
?>
OUTPUTS: 
Paris

Notes:
'default' is needed in every switch() and should be at the end.
'break' will exit the switch().
If you do not have a 'break' in your case, it will run the code in every case below it
until it does hit a break. See the next example.


EXAMPLE 2: (multiple case fall-through)
<?php
	$age = 17;
	
	switch($age){
		case 0:
		case 1:
			echo "infant";
			break;
		case 2:
		case 3:
		case 4:
			echo "toddler";
			break;
		case 6:
		case 7:
		case 8:
		case 9:
		case 10:
		case 11:
		case 12:
			echo "pre-teen";
			break;
		case 13:
		case 14:
		case 15:
		case 16:
		case 17:
		case 18:
		case 19:
			echo "teenager";
			break;
		default:
			echo "adult";
			break;
?>
OUTPUTS:
teenager

NOTES:
So if you want the same result from multiple cases,
you can just have a bunch of empty cases and it will
start at the case that matches and then will run the code in
every case downward until it hits one with a break.
