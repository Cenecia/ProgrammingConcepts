1- What is the output of the above code?


2- What would the output be if $c was set to "Bart"?


3- What would the output be if $c was set to "Jerry"?


<?php
	$c = 0;
	while($c < 10){
		echo $c;
		echo ",";
		c++;
	}
?>

4 - What is the output of the above code?


5 - Write a for() loop that does the same thing as that while loop.
